# ServeML: What to Do Next

## We've Completed the Planning! ðŸŽ¯

We now have:
1. âœ… Complete system architecture
2. âœ… API design and endpoints
3. âœ… Frontend component structure
4. âœ… Model serving strategy
5. âœ… Step-by-step MVP guide

## Your Next Actions

### Option 1: Start Building Locally (Recommended)
Start with the MVP implementation without AWS to test the concept:

```bash
# 1. Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/gnanirahulnutakki/serveml.git
cd serveml

# 2. Create the basic structure
mkdir -p backend frontend .github/workflows
mkdir -p backend/templates backend/uploads

# 3. Start with the simple FastAPI backend
# Copy code from docs/MVP_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
```

**Why start locally?**
- Test the entire flow without AWS costs
- Debug easier in local environment
- Validate the architecture works
- Build confidence before cloud deployment

### Option 2: Set Up AWS First
If you prefer to set up AWS infrastructure:

1. **Create AWS Account**
   - Go to https://aws.amazon.com
   - Create a new account (or use existing)
   - Set up billing alerts

2. **Install AWS CLI**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install awscli
   
   # Configure
   aws configure
   ```

3. **Create Basic Resources**
   - S3 bucket for uploads
   - ECR repository for containers
   - IAM roles for Lambda

### Option 3: Start with Frontend
Build a simple upload interface:

1. Create `frontend/index.html` (code in MVP guide)
2. Add basic styling
3. Test file uploads locally
4. Build user experience first

## Recommended Development Order

### Week 1: Local MVP
1. **Day 1-2**: Set up FastAPI backend
   - Basic file upload endpoint
   - In-memory deployment tracking
   - Health check endpoint

2. **Day 3-4**: Create simple frontend
   - HTML upload form
   - JavaScript for API calls
   - Basic status display

3. **Day 5-7**: Model serving wrapper
   - Python script that loads .pkl files
   - Test with scikit-learn models
   - Docker container for local testing

### Week 2: AWS Integration
1. **Day 1-2**: AWS account and basic setup
   - Create S3 buckets
   - Set up IAM roles
   - Configure AWS CLI

2. **Day 3-4**: Terraform basics
   - Write S3 and DynamoDB modules
   - Create ECR repository
   - Test infrastructure

3. **Day 5-7**: Connect backend to AWS
   - S3 file uploads
   - DynamoDB for persistence
   - Test end-to-end

### Week 3: Automation
1. **Day 1-3**: GitHub Actions
   - Docker build workflow
   - ECR push automation
   - Lambda deployment

2. **Day 4-5**: S3 triggers
   - Lambda function for events
   - Trigger GitHub Actions
   - Test automation

3. **Day 6-7**: First real deployment
   - Deploy a real model
   - Test predictions
   - Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Backend development
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
uvicorn app:app --reload

# Frontend development
cd frontend
python -m http.server 3000
# Visit http://localhost:3000

# Create test model
python create_test_model.py
```

## Questions to Answer Before Starting

1. **Do you have an AWS account?**
   - If no, create one or start with local development
   - If yes, ensure you have admin access

2. **Are you comfortable with Docker?**
   - If no, focus on Python code first
   - If yes, start containerizing early

3. **What's your primary goal?**
   - Learning? Start with local MVP
   - Production? Set up AWS properly
   - Demo? Focus on frontend first
